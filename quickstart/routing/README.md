# ðŸŽŒ Routing

The routing system in FastVolt Framework plays a pivotal role in directing incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controllers and actions. It allows developers to define routes for various HTTP methods, making it easy to create RESTful APIs, web applications, or any other type of HTTP-based service.

In this documentation, you'll learn how to define, configure, and leverage the routing system in FastVolt Framework to handle incoming requests and build robust web applications.

Before diving into routing, ensure that FastVolt Framework is properly installed and configured in your project. Refer to the installation documentation for detailed instructions.


Routing in FastVolt is simple and expressive. You can define routes for various HTTP methods by importing the `Request` Package/Class provided by the framework.

```php
<?php

use FastVolt/Router/Route;

```

In the next page, we will discuss more on the router implementation in the main development scenario.
