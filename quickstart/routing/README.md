## Initialization

```php
use FastVolt/Router/Route;
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Fastvolt routes are defined in **.route** files, which are located in the <mark style="color:red;">**`routes/`**</mark> directory.
{% endhint %}

\
In this documentation, you'll learn how to define, configure, and leverage the routing system in Fastvolt Framework to handle incoming requests and build robust web applications.\


Before diving into routing, ensure that Fastvolt Framework is properly installed and configured in your project, refer to the installation documentation for detailed instructions.\

[configurations.md](../../overview/configurations.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../overview/installation.md" %}
[installation.md](../../overview/installation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

After properly configuring your application, then you can proceed to:
